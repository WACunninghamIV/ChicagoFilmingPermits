#Chicago Filing Permits

For this project, we looked at different filming permits and their application status throughout Chicago. Our group constructed a map of the different statuses and locations. Filming permits in the city allow anyone to stop traffic around a designated area in order to film the desired project, whether it is a movie or class project.

We also have famous TV show and Film locations that are based in Chicago i.e. "Shameless"
